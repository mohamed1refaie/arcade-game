## Project Overview

Frogger Arcade Game made with Object-Oriented JavaScript

## How The Game Works

The game is simply try to move the player from the start position to the river without any collisions with the bugs, if the player get hit by a bug he starts again from the start position.
Each time you reach the river your score increases by one.

You have only 4 valid moves (up,down,right,left)
